h1. Detego

Detego is a JRuby application container... "Server page":server

Found a bug ? Please post it on "lighthouse":lighthouse


h2. Quickstart

Startup is easy, just run the boot script:

|{border:1px solid black;background:#ddd}. jruby -S run.rb|

After this 3 services will be available (tho no expose services have been made, so they're currently only available inside the container.).


*Deployer*

Will poll the filesystem every so often(default every 120sec.) to see if a new zip or directory has been placed. If so i will try to install it as a service.


*Example*

An example service to see how it all fits together, has some trivial methods. 


*Webinterface*

Well, go and see! Wait for WEBrick to boot and goto "your server interface":your_server
