h1. Detego

Detego is a JRuby:http://jruby.codehaus.org/ application container... See "Server page":server page for more details.

Found a bug ? Please post it on "lighthouse":lighthouse


h2. Quickstart

Startup is easy, just run the boot script:

|{background:#ddd}. jruby -S run.rb|

After this 3 services will be available (tho no expose services have been made, so they're currently only available inside the container.).


*Deployer*

Will poll the filesystem every so often(default every 120sec.) to see if a new zip or directory has been placed. If so i will try to install it as a service.


*Example*

An example service to see how it all fits together, has some trivial methods. 


*Webinterface*

Well, go and see! Wait for WEBrick to boot and goto "your server interface":your_server



h2. Dir. Structure

* app
 the core of container
* config
* contained
 All the pre-installed services, include a management interface(rails), a deployer and an example to demostrate usage
