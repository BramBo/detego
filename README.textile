h2. About

Detego is a JRuby application container(Calling it an application server would probably be an overstatement). The basic idea of Detego is to give (small) applications(_services_) an easy way to offer their functionalities to the outside world.  Let's say for instance you have a small application that schedules cronjobs, now you want to be able to simply access this "cronjob scheduler" from some other place(different computer/ruby instance/language). To achieve this you would have to write an interface for it, and also keep the service in the air. Basicly write a tiny server for the interface........ "More info.":home
